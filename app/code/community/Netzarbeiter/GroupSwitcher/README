This extension enables you to automatically change a customers group when specific conditions are met.
Possible conditions are:
- A specific product is brought
- A certain amount of orders (or more) have been placed by the customer
- The customer has generated a certain (or higher) turnover, total or over the last N days
- An order with a specific total (or higher) is placed

The details of the conditions can configured as follows:
- Customer group to switch the customer to
- Rule trigger type
- Rule condition value (the SKU, or the amounts).
  For turnver time triggers, enter the number of days, then a pipe symbol |, then the amount.
- Apply rule only if the customer currently is in a specific group
- Apply rule only if the order matches a specific status (pending, complete, ...)
- Apply rule only to orders from specific store views

USAGE:
After the installation there is a new menu entry in the admin interface under
Customers > Customer Groups > Group Switch Rules

There you can add as many rules as you need in the usual magento way.

CONFIGURATION:
You can disable the extension on a store view level at
System > Configuration > Customer Configuration > Customer Group Switcher

CHANGELOG:
0.1.8	Add trigger types to check the turnover the last N days
0.1.7	Initial Release

TODO:
- Add German locale
- Add customer email domain rule type
- Add a group-code property. When cutomers enter a code they are switched to a specfic customer group.
  This code shoud entered during registration.
- Do I want to limit NumOrders and TotalTurnover selects to orders from the store_id's of the rule??
- Ajax search autocomplete when entering sku's
- Hide store_ids multiselect on single store installations
- Mass update rule status
